You step out into a desolate wasteland of tattered and heavily tarnished metal walls in a place where machines once came to die.\nThe ground was covered in a confetti of mechanical pieces and the tombs of steel piled high into the smog hovering above.";
    public static String r2a = "Sector 2a.\nAfter continuing further you find a massive fence compiled of scrap and broken machines affectively arranged to keep something from getting in or even out?\nYou manage your way through a small gap in between sheet metal and barbed wire nearly losing a limb.";
    public static String r1b = "Sector 1b.\nManeuvering your way over piles of junk nearly impossible to walk on you spot a seemingly unpassable great wall of clutter.\nAs you make your way closer you find a wrecked car built into the wall perfectly to climb through to the other side.";
    public static String r2b = "Sector 2b.\nYou see vast areas of lush green grass with friendly wildlife roaming the land and beautiful blue skies soaring above.";

    public static String r3b = "Sector 3b.\nScuttling your way through dense bushes you suddenly come to the edge of a ginormous canyon blocking passage to the east while nearly falling to your death.\nAfter recovering from your near death experience you notice a bulky object covered by a thick layer of old rotted branches and foilage.";
    public static String r1c = "Sector 1c.\nMoving your way into an opening you are suddenly ambushed by a pack of rabid cyber rabbits and are unable to find a way out.";
    public static String r1d = "Sector 1d.\nYou approach a small shack seemed to of been blown to pieces and piles of brick rubble and shrapnel scattered about with nothing left standing but a lonely door frame.\nYou notice a chill breeze and the gloomy stare of  dark clouds overhead against the moon in the night sky.";
    public static String r1e = "Sector 1e.\nEnduring winds of deathly speeds you see nothing but a old wood bridge and trees bowing around you. You attempt to take cover under the bridge. Nothing is audible but the shrieking wind and the moaning creaks of the bridge as it begins to collapse above you, you attempt to evade the it but are instead met with a piece of shrapnel through your heart.";
    public static String r2c = "Sector 2c.\nWith a sense of peace you stumble uppon a vivid meadow filled with beautiful and exotic flowers of all kinds with the sounds of birds chirping and streams flowing.";
    public static String r2d = "Sector 2d.\nYou enter an expansive landscape of grass and sunlight with no trees in sight but the way you came from.";

    public static String r3d = "Sector 3d.\nIn an instant following a small stream quickly turned into a river with raging rapids and fast flowing waters to the east.";
    public static String r3e = "Sector 3e.\nYou come to a small creak broken off from a stream, everything is still and calm.";
    public static String r4a = "Sector 4a.\nAfter passing over a hill you see a dense thicket of a dark forest to the east and a steep drop off to the south.";
    public static String r4b = "Sector 4b.\nApproaching the drop off you see how vast this canyon is, the cliff is too high to jump from. Fortunately you spot a ladder at the very tip of the crag.";
    public static String r4c = "Sector 4c.\nYou reach the bottom\nThe only sound to be heard was the soft trickling of the stream running beneath, and the occasional unfortunate pebble that plundered in.\nThe claustraphobia could be felt eminating from the sandy, jagged walls.";
    public static String r4d = "Sector 4d.\nYou saunter through a natural avenue of trees, it is shady, dark and cool almost cold. As you come to the end of the trees it opens up into a lake. The air is warmer, the sounds of insects are almost too loud.";
    public static String r4e = "Sector 4e.\nArriving at a lakefront, the lake seems like a black void with the sun bouncing off the surface and a plopping sound as a fish breaks the water, rippling wide.";
    public static String r5a = "Sector 5a.\nIntruding into a dark forest of seemingly ancient evils the air was stuffy the trees staring at you like silent senturies. A hair raising place with a pretentious odor.";
    public static String r5b = "Sector 5b.\nSetting foot at the peak of a canyon looking down you see a deep valley with steep sides and a small stream flowing steadily through the bottom.";
    public static String r5c = "Sector 5c.\nBreaching a clearing you suddenly realize you are in a encampment filled with bandits.";
    public static String r5d = "Sector 5d.\nYou make way to a landform extending high above the surrounding land with clouds leading over the sky.";
    public static String r5e = "Sector 5e.\nYou insinuate into a low area circled by mountains in the distance with fertile untouched grounds.";

    public static String r6c = "Sector 6c.\nAs a river speeds by, you appear to be in the bottom of a canyon, undisturbed by any life falling from above. There is a narrow path on either side; just wide enough for a person to sneak along.\nFallen rocks from the walls of the canyon litter the path with only a sliver of light guiding you overhead.";
    public static String r6d = "Sector 6d.\nDeparting the low regions you step on the foot of a snow capped alpine scattered with goats and rams along the shoulder.";

    public static String r7e = "Sector 7e.\nCrowding your way into a narrow dark cave you stumble and catch yourself, but not without a shout of pain causing a loose stalagtite to fall from above piercing your skull.";

    public static String r8d = "Sector 8d.\nThe walls of the cave were melted into hardened metal with parts of the ground cinged and ashy, within the cave there is a wide assortment of metals collected from all the world piled into a nest of ash within, and in the middle there lies the dragon.";

It's harrow at the mouth of the cave, stalagmites and stalagtites forming.\nIf one travels the cluttered terrain, they can then discover the dark, open cave with tremendous space. The walls are moist and bats hang up at the top.";
    public static String r9d = "Sector 9d.\nDark purple and deep black splotches on the metal walls the air is almost not breathable, looking foward you can only see a few feet infront of you surrounded by a dense cloud of ash and smoke.";
    public static String r9e = "Sector 9e.\nCongradulations. After stepping out into the open air your past suddenly hits you and as you read the initials on a rock you relize you were the one who constructed this diabolical labyrinth.";
